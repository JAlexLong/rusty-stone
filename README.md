# rusty-stone

This is very much a WIP for now, but this project has been the one I've wanted to do since I was a teenager - my first attempt was in Python while I was learning *that* language. After I implement the core-functionality I want to take it a step further by making a cool little cli/tui for the game of go, too.

## Todo
- Make board altering functions in crate::board::Board
- Legal move detection (no ko)
- Flesh out crate::game 
- Add final scoring (literal scoring only, no life and death)
- Make a cli interface to test/play locally
- Make a random bot
- Make a basic bot
- - atari detection
- - ladder detection?
- Add Player vs Bot, Bot vs Bot
